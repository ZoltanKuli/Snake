# The Story Behind Snake

I made Snake for my Software Technology class during the fall of 2020.

What was really interesting about this project is that I managed to create a Java Swing GUI that doesn't strikingly look like a Java Swing GUI.

First of all, the game window is in fullscreen, and it successfully adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions.

What's more, I implemented my own menu system and used a library called FlatLaf to make the whole experience just a little more aesthetically pleasing.

And to top it all that, in the main menu's background, the top 100 previous attempts are replayed.
