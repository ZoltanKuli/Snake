# The Story Behind Snake

I made Snake during the fall of 2020 for my second web development class.

The main idea behind this project was to start learning JavaScript and getting more comfortable with it.

This was a simple project, but I did get better at JavaScript because of it, and it was fun making a game that was similar to an iconic part of my childhood.

I would sometimes play the classic Snake on my parent's Nokia phone when I was young. And it felt nice trying to recreate that experience.

Of course, nothing will have quite the feel of the original:)
